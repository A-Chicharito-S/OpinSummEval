My daughter noted that her meat was weird in her gyro - some jagged chunks, large cubes, and thin slices. The taste wasn't up to snuff either--likely from the less than optimal way it was prepared.

I had the gyro with the meat sauce and was not disappointed. I'm not a big fan of chicken but it was a delicious treat. Staff was friendly, but they need to add a bit more to the Greek dressing and it's a treat to be healthy.

It just doesn't taste like Mexican food. The ingredients are there, but the nuance of cooking, maybe how they roast their chilis and the combination of spices, doesn't taste authentic. The quac, I don't taste that balance of red onion, lime, salt, jalepeno, cilantro, garlic, a touch of olive oil. Tortilla strips look nice, but is too thick and dense. I want my chip to be light, crisp and thin. Crunch, gone. ", "rev4": " One of the best Mexican restaurants in town! Family style servings and food tastes legit.

Succulent meats (we had the braised beef shoulder and the pork belly) with all the fixings for more-than-you-can-reasonably-eat tacos (the dishes come with tortillas, beans, rice, and salsas for flavor).

There is enough drizzle to where you can still taste the shrimp. And placed underneath is a mound of cantaloupe and honeydew, I have never tasted a more perfect combination.

The decor is a yawn and the vibe is like being in an elevator with that horrible music.  The cocktails were fine and ordered some small stuff.
