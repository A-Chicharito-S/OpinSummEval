The service is excellent, crumber for the table, fresh cracked pepper, wine poured once your glass gets low, complete attention to detail. The \"bread\" that's brought is a full olive and cheese spread. The caesar salad is delicious. The scallops are cooked to perfection and the pairings on the plate were unbelievable.
