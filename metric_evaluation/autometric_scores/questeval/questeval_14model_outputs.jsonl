I especially liked the Dragon Roll from the 8 sushis we tried here. We tried the Dean's, Dragon, Veggie, Rock and Roll, twister, American Dream and two others. I could say the dragon and rock and roll were among my most favorite ones but the veggies was probably the least favorite.", "rev3": "We went on a surprise date to a new place.   They were totally packed and had 2 servers on. Maybe a call off and that happens. But our server could barely get to us and just dropped food and ran. If she really looked, she would have seen we didn't eat one sushi roll.  The Dean. Pureed and super fishy.  The Udon Noodles seemed Way over cooked. Wine list was crap, but I wasn't expecting anything great.  We left hungry and will not return because of the food. I can forgive some slow service.", "rev4": " I heard great things about this place, which is why I was really looking forward to it.

I ordered the Sushi deluxe meal, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri (fish on top of rice, which is the only sushi in Japan.) This comes with miso soup and the common sesame ginger salad. The miso soup was flat in flavor and the salad was OK. A bit too much sweetness/acidity from the dressing. The sushi selection was predictable. Tuna, salmon, snapper, and bbq eel. The fish was very creamy in mouthfeel (excellent) but none of them impressed me in flavor except the bbq eel, which was smoky and sweet.
