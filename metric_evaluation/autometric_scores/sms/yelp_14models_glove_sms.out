On another note after having waited this long my smoothie was watered down and bitter...I was in a rush so I just left.

1232	Pretty basic bar. Claims to be country, but country it is not. I've been to real country bars and it's completely different. The atmosphere here is mostly college students and the bar itself isn't the cleanest.

Drinks are ok though, but nothing amazing.	this is a great place to have a good time.  i love the fact that they have live music.  it's a college town bar with a little bit of a country feel to it.  the bartenders are always friendly and the drinks are good.  they have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two-step and doing it well.   the only thing i don't like is that they don't have a live band.	0.05962196482307243

This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar.
