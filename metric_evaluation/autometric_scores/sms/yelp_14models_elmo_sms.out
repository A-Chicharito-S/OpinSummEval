Is it normal to wait for a smoothie for over 15 minutes when there are only 2 tables filled with people in the entire place?

On another note after having waited this long my smoothie was watered down and bitter...I was in a rush so I just left.

I honestly wasn't expecting much. It's kinda in the middle of nowhere in a sense. We were looking for it, not realizing it was a restaurant converted from a house. And when you get inside it's super cramped. But once you taste the food you will fall in love. I had the carnitas. Was really good. The meat is served with guacamole, homemade salsa, and a spicy sauce. And of course you get the tortilla. Yes you make it yourself. But it adds to the fun. Was good food and fun.

Really good experiences at this restaurant.	I made a reservation for my 1st anniversary. I was so disappointed when they brought my dessert plate to the table. It was simple it didn't have written letters saying HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.. I was expecting something better since it was our special night. However, I called the location twice to confirmed they had everything I requested. I don't recommend people to go there for special occasions... I would give  1  for the hostess /managers  4  stars for the server because it was not his fault about the dessert plate.. it was for the people that made  my reservation..	8.223162698237976e-05

I recommend the delicious sashimi.	i love this place. the sushi is delicious and the sashimi is fresh. i love the chirashi and the chicken wings. all are very good. need to wait during lunch and dinner. a little bit pricey but taste of food deserve it. this place is nothing fancy. flat tap water on every table. your standard miso soup. $17 for a lunch special got me maybe 3-4 ounces of meat and one roll that was pretty good but fried and prepared earlier.	3.197959966995969e-05

I came here because Naruto likes ramen and I've rarely had it outside those really cheap bags of noodles you boil when you're in college. Or at work for lunch. I was a solo lunch diner, as I had dipped out of a conference for some better food than the conference center was offering. This place delivered. It was clean and the service was FAST. The ramen was delicious, and the recommendation of the server was spot on. Decor was modern and had several nods to anime. If I lived in the area I would probably be back here. Naruto was right, ramen is yummy!	0.00011897805392180231

The best experience was had by an Indian visitor who found the server to be very friendly and welcoming.

This place is the quintessential fake country bar. I guess you cant expect anything different from a mill ave/college town bar. The drinks are over priced and the music is terrible. The only saving grace to this place is the day time bar staff are really hospitable. The night time staff however, not so much but that is to be expected of a high volume bar. If you're looking for a country bar, this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for another stereotypical college town party bar, this is your place.	8.580691591000692e-05
