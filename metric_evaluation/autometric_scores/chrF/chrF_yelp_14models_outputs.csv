","who would have thought that december would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at dean and deluca ? that is what i did today and it was divine . i love coming here to build my own salad . i had the pear vinaigrette dressing and i could have sucked that up through a straw . even though it is a little pricey , the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best . it ' s also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items . the atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping . definitely a winner in charlotte .

","I really like this restaurant! We have been here a handful of times in the past year and have never had a bad experience. The waiting staff has always been friendly and we usually have top-notch service. I love sitting outside near the fireplace when the weather is nice...great atmosphere! I really enjoy the burgers and the chicken and dumpling soup. Yummy! And although I've never saved enough room for dessert, I have seen the awesome cookie skillet and heard it is delicious! I'll have to remember to go there one day just for the cookie skillet. :)
